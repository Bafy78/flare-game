Remixed from Clint Bellanger's potion icons:

Notes:
As with Clint's originals, the Blender files are intended for Blender 2.7 and
its default renderer.  Saving the rendered image from Blender has some issues
with the alpha channel. So my post-process in GIMP is:

1. Add a black background layer
2. On the rendered layer, edit the Levels. Under Output Levels, change the Low
Output (the black side) to 255.
